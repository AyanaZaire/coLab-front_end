# coLab Frontend

coLab is a team building platform for community projects.

**The backend for this application can be found [here](https://github.com/AyanaZaire/coLab).**

coLab uses Ruby on Rails as the framework for building the backend. coLab leverages `sqlite3` as the database for Active Record. The frontend of the application is built using React providing the UI for members to fetch and change data from the backend.  

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Once the server is running, you should now be able to demo the application via the frontend.  See backend initialization instructions at [coLab's backend repository](https://github.com/AyanaZaire/coLab).

## Usage

Members can create a profile based on their skill and availability. Members can also create community projects outlining the start date, end date, description, and how many members are needed to complete the project. Community project admins can add members to the project based on availability or delete the project after it is complete.

As a community member, one can:
- View all member profiles
- See all ongoing community projects
- Create a community project
- Build a team for a community project
- Delete a community project
